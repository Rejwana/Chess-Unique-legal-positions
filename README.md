# Chess-Unique-legal-positions

Here I created a MySQL database that stores chess endgame perfect play information in plaintext formal. Syzygy and Gaviota are used to create the database. As these tablebases are compressed using different types of indexing, it is not directly possible to iterate through all unique legal positions. Therefore in this project, an iterable version of the chess endgame tablebase is created for tablebases up to 5pieces.
